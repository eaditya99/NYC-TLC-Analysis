# NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) Trip Analysis

## Background
The NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) is the regulatory body responsible for licensing and regulating New York City's medallion (yellow) taxis, for-hire vehicles (including green Boro Taxis, black cars, and livery cars), commuter vans, and paratransit vehicles. The TLC's mission is to ensure that these services are safe, efficient, and accessible for the public.

## Problem Statement
The NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) oversees the regulation of yellow and green taxis in New York City, ensuring the provision of safe, efficient, and accessible transportation services. However, the dynamic nature of urban transportation presents several challenges:

1. **Optimizing Fleet Operations**: Taxi companies need to manage their fleets efficiently to reduce idle time, meet fluctuating demand, and minimize operational costs.
2. **Improving Customer Satisfaction**: Understanding passenger behavior and preferences is crucial for enhancing service quality and customer satisfaction.
3. **Maximizing Revenue**: Identifying factors that influence fare amounts, tips, and additional charges can help in devising strategies to maximize revenue.
4. **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensuring that all taxi services comply with city regulations regarding fares, surcharges, and reporting requirements.
5. **Assessing Weather Impact**: Understanding how weather conditions influence the demand for taxi services to improve operational planning and customer service.

## Objective
To address these challenges, we aim to leverage the NYC TLC Trip Record dataset to:

1. Analyze Demand Patterns: Identify peak times, popular routes, and high-demand locations to optimize fleet deployment.
2. Assess Operational Efficiency: Evaluate trip durations, distances, and idle times to improve operational efficiency.
3. Understand Customer Behavior: Analyze passenger counts, payment methods, and tip amounts to gain insights into customer preferences.
4. Revenue Analysis: Break down fare structures and additional charges to identify revenue optimization opportunities.
5. Assess Weather Impact: Evaluate how different weather conditions affect the demand for taxi services to enhance operational decision-making and customer satisfaction.

## Research Questions

### 1. Demand Analysis:
- What are the peak hours for taxi services?
- Which locations have the highest pickup and dropoff frequencies?

### 2. Operational Efficiency:
- What are the average trip durations and distances?
- How can fleet deployment be optimized based on trip data?

### 3. Customer Insights:
- What are the common payment methods used by passengers?
- How do tip amounts vary based on different factors (e.g., trip distance, fare amount)?

### 4. Revenue Optimization:
- What are the key components of fare amounts?
- What factors impact tip amounts?

### 5. Weather Impact:
- How do weather conditions (e.g., rain, snow, temperature) affect the demand for taxi services?
- Are there specific weather conditions that significantly increase or decrease taxi usage?
